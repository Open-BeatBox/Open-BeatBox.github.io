    title: "Scientific rationale"
    body: |
      Beatbox enables measurement of both spontaneous and task-driven behaviors in an ecological context. Continuous monitoring reduces stress, increases voluntary engagement, and provides richer data per animal.

      Scientific motivations include:
      - Studying complex learning sequences
      - Measuring long-term dynamics of motivation and cognition
      - Improving reproducibility through standardized environmental capture
      - Reducing the number of animals by improving within-animal resolution

  - type: "warning"
    title: "Limitations & responsible use"
    body: |
      Beatbox is not a full camera-based home-cage monitoring system and does not replace detailed video ethograms. It is also not a turnkey solution for all possible cognitive paradigms.

      Users must validate their specific tasks and ensure compliance with local ethical and regulatory requirements.
