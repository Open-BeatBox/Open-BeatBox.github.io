    title: "Who uses Beatbox?"
    body: |
      Beatbox is designed for behavioral neuroscience labs, preclinical platforms, and facilities interested in open, ecological monitoring and operant tasks in the home cage.

    items:
      - question: "What sensors does Beatbox support?"
        answer: "Beatbox supports environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, light) and behavioral sensors such as IR beam breaks, nosepoke sensors, and capacitive touch modules. Exact sensor models can be configured per build."
      - question: "Can Beatbox integrate with video-based HCM systems?"
        answer: "Yes. Beatbox is designed to complement camera-based systems and can be synchronized via software and, where available, hardware triggers."
      - question: "What are the power and network requirements?"
        answer: "Typical setups require a stable power source and either USB or Wi-Fi for data transfer. Detailed requirements depend on the final hardware configuration."
