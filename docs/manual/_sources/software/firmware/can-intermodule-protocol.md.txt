# Inter-module CAN protocol

This is the **specification of the messages** that the main module and the peripheral modules exchange on the CAN bus. It is the reference for anyone writing firmware or a new module, or debugging the bus. If you only want to *use* the box, you do not need it: see {doc}`cli` and {doc}`../pc-app`.

```{warning}
This protocol is under active development and may change as the firmware evolves. The specification below is the Software repository document `micropython/beatbox_intermodule_protocol.MD`; section 8 lists where the **current code differs** from it. Record the software version when you integrate with it.
```

## In plain words

- **CAN** is a two-wire network on which every message is broadcast to every module. Each message carries an **11-bit identifier** and **0 to 8 bytes of data**.
- The identifier says **how urgent** the message is, **which module** it concerns, **what kind** of message it is, and **which command** it is. Modules ignore messages that are not for them.
- When two modules speak at once, the one with the **lower identifier wins** and the other waits, so urgent messages (errors) come first.
- Modules **announce events by themselves** (a response on a screen, a pellet detected, a beam broken); the host does not have to ask repeatedly.

## 1) Identifier layout (11-bit standard CAN)

Open-BEATBox uses standard 11-bit CAN IDs.

### 1.1 Field ordering (MSB -> LSB)

| Bits  | Size | Field  | Meaning |
|-------|------|--------|---------|
| 10..8 | 3    | PRIO   | Arbitration priority class (`0` highest) |
| 7..4  | 4    | MODULE | Target module for request, source module for response |
| 3..2  | 2    | TYPE   | Message class and direction |
| 1..0  | 2    | CMD    | Command index inside the selected TYPE namespace |

Once a module is selected by `MODULE`, the message meaning is described by 3 protocol fields: `PRIO`, `TYPE`, `CMD` (plus payload).

Payload is 0..8 bytes. RTR is not used.

### 1.2 Encoding formula

`CAN_ID = (PRIO << 8) | (MODULE << 4) | (TYPE << 2) | CMD`

| PRIO | Class         | Typical usage |

## 2) Global dictionaries

### 2.1 Priority classes (`PRIO`)

| PRIO | Class         | Typical usage |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| 000  | P0 highest    | Critical errors, safety urgent |
| 001  | P1 high       | Control commands (start/stop/reset/reward) |
| 010  | P2 medium     | Real-time events (nosepoke, touch, barrier edge) |
| 011  | P3 normal     | Status and ACK traffic |
| 100  | P4 background | Telemetry / periodic reporting |
| 101..111 | Reserved  | Future use |

### 2.2 Type classes (`TYPE`)

| TYPE | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 00   | Common request |
| 01   | Common response |
| 10   | Module-specific request |
| 11   | Module-specific response |

### 2.3 Module IDs (`MODULE`)

| Module            | Value |
|-------------------|-------|
| GENERIC           | 0x0 |
| MAIN              | 0x1 |
| FEEDER            | 0x2 |
| NOSEPOKE          | 0x3 |
| SCREEN_LEFT       | 0x4 |
| SCREEN_RIGHT      | 0x5 |
| LIGHTING          | 0x6 |
| IR_BARRIER        | 0x7 |
| BROADCAST target  | 0xF |

No response may use `MODULE=0xF`.

## 3) Common namespace (`TYPE=00` / `TYPE=01`)

`CMD` values are global in this namespace.

| TYPE | CMD | Name       | Direction | Default PRIO | Payload |
|------|-----|------------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| 00   | 00  | SCAN       | Request   | P3           | none |
| 01   | 00  | SCAN_REPLY | Response  | P3           | `status_code:uint8` |
| 00   | 01  | GET_STATUS | Request   | P3           | none |
| 01   | 01  | STATUS     | Response  | P3           | `status_code:uint8` |
| 01   | 10  | ERROR      | Response  | P0           | `error_code:uint8` (+ optional module-specific context bytes) |
| 00   | 11  | RESET      | Request   | P1           | `delay_ms:uint16` big-endian |

Modules may append context bytes after `error_code`. Receivers must tolerate an
`ERROR` payload longer than one byte. See section 4.1 for the feeder case.

Status values:
- `0`: INIT
- `1`: IDLE
- `2`: ACTIVE
- `3`: ERROR

## 4) Module-specific namespace (`TYPE=10` / `TYPE=11`)

`CMD` is module-local in this namespace.

### 4.0 Generic (`MODULE=0x0`)

| TYPE | CMD | Name               | Direction | Default PRIO | Payload |
|------|-----|--------------------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| 10   | 00  | TOGGLE_CAN_LED     | Request   | P1           | none |
| 11   | 00  | CAN_LED_STATE      | Response  | P3           | `state:uint8` (`0` off, `1` on, `255` unknown) |
| 11   | 01  | USER_BUTTON_EVENT  | Response  | P2           | `pressed:uint8` (`1` pressed) |

### 4.1 Feeder (`MODULE=0x2`)

| TYPE | CMD | Name              | Direction | Default PRIO | Payload                                 |
|------|-----|-------------------|-----------|--------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 10   | 00  | GET_REWARD_STATUS | Request   | P3           | none                                    |
| 10   | 01  | REQUEST_REWARD    | Request   | P1           | none                                    |
| 10   | 10  | REWARD_ON         | Request   | P1           | none                                    |
| 10   | 11  | REWARD_OFF        | Request   | P1           | none                                    |
| 11   | 00  | REWARD_STATUS     | Response  | P3 / P2      | `state:uint8, attempts:uint8`           |

`REWARD_STATUS` is the feeder's only module response. Its payload is two bytes:

| Byte | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0    | `state:uint8` = pellet presence, `1` pellet in the IR beam, `0` beam clear |
| 1    | `attempts:uint8` = attempts made during the last autonomous delivery |

It is sent at `P3` when it answers a request (`GET_REWARD_STATUS`, or the end of
a `REQUEST_REWARD` cycle), and at `P2` when it reports a spontaneous pellet
presence change (see *Pellet presence reporting*).

All feeder requests must be addressed to `MODULE=0x2`; the feeder ignores
module requests received on `BROADCAST`, so a reward is never delivered by
accident.

`REQUEST_REWARD` and `REWARD_ON` are mutually exclusive: each is ignored while
the other is active.

#### Delivery sequence (`REQUEST_REWARD`, autonomous)

One reward step is 1/25 of a revolution of the feeder disc. Pellet arrival is
detected by an IR barrier interrupt local to the feeder module.

1. Main sends `REQUEST_REWARD`. The feeder switches to `ACTIVE` and starts
   turning. A second `REQUEST_REWARD` received while a delivery is running is
   ignored; poll `GET_STATUS` to observe progress.
2. The feeder turns 1/25 revolution, then waits up to 500 ms for the pellet.
3. If no pellet is detected, it retries from step 2, up to 20 attempts total
   (about four fifths of a revolution of the disc).
4. On detection the motor stops immediately, the module returns to `IDLE` and
   sends `REWARD_STATUS` at `P3`. The `attempts` byte reports how many attempts
   were needed: `1` on first try, up to `20`.

If a pellet is already in the beam when `REQUEST_REWARD` arrives, the disc does
not turn: the feeder stays `IDLE` and answers `REWARD_STATUS` with `state=1` and
`attempts=0`.

A reward therefore completes in about 500 ms in the nominal case, and can take
up to ~10 s before being reported as failed. Main must not assume a fixed
latency between `REQUEST_REWARD` and its `REWARD_STATUS`.

An `attempts` value consistently greater than `1` indicates a feeder running low
or a disc starting to jam, and is worth logging as a health metric.

#### Manual control (`REWARD_ON` / `REWARD_OFF`, V2-style)

`REWARD_ON` turns the disc continuously until `REWARD_OFF`, mirroring the V2
reward TTL line: main owns the timing and the retries. The module switches to
`ACTIVE` and runs the motor at a fifth of the nominal step rate.

- `REWARD_ON` is idempotent: a second one while the motor runs is a no-op.
- `REWARD_ON` is ignored while an autonomous delivery is running.
- The feeder stops by itself after 15 s without a `REWARD_OFF`, so a lost link
  mid-delivery cannot spin the disc forever. Main's longest reward pulse must
  stay below that.
- `REWARD_OFF` also acts as an emergency stop: it aborts an autonomous
  `REQUEST_REWARD` cycle in progress.

Neither command answers with a `REWARD_STATUS` of its own; the pellet that comes
out is reported by the presence events below.

#### Pellet presence reporting

The feeder publishes `REWARD_STATUS` at `P2` (event priority) on every pellet
presence change, independently of what triggered it. Main sees both edges:

- `state=1` is latched by the IR barrier interrupt and sent immediately, so a
  pellet transiting faster than the 10 ms poll period is never missed.
- `state=0` is sent once the beam has been continuously clear for 50 ms.

This works whether the barrier watches the chute (transit: `1` then `0` shortly
after) or the food well (presence: `0` only once the animal takes the pellet).
The `attempts` byte carries the count from the last autonomous delivery and is
unchanged by these events.

#### Delivery failure

If the 20 attempts elapse without a pellet, the feeder sends the common `ERROR`
response (`TYPE=01`, `CMD=10`, `P0`) instead of a `P3` `REWARD_STATUS`, and stays
in `ERROR` status until the next successful reward.

The error payload extends the generic `error_code:uint8` form with the command
that failed and the number of attempts made:

| Byte | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0    | `error_code:uint8` = failing command, `0x01` for `REQUEST_REWARD` |
| 1    | `attempts:uint8` = attempts made before giving up (`20`) |

No `P3` `REWARD_STATUS` is emitted in this case. A new `REQUEST_REWARD` is
accepted while the module is in `ERROR`, so main can retry after refilling.

A cycle aborted by `REWARD_OFF` is silent: the module returns to `IDLE` without
an `ERROR` and without a `REWARD_STATUS`.

### 4.2 Nosepoke (`MODULE=0x3`)

| TYPE | CMD | Name            | Direction | Default PRIO | Payload |
|------|-----|-----------------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| 10   | 00  | GET_BEAM_STATUS | Request   | P3           | none |
| 11   | 00  | BEAM_STATUS     | Response  | P3           | `beam:uint8` (`0` clear, `1` broken) |
| 11   | 01  | BEAM_EVENT      | Response  | P2           | `beam:uint8` (`1` when poke event detected) |

### 4.3 Screen left/right (`MODULE=0x4` / `0x5`)

Screen side is encoded by module ID, so payload has no side field.

| TYPE | CMD | Name                | Direction | Default PRIO | Payload |
|------|-----|---------------------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| 10   | 00  | DISPLAY_PATTERN     | Request   | P1           | `pattern_id:uint8` |
| 11   | 00  | DISPLAY_PATTERN_ACK | Response  | P3           | `pattern_id:uint8` |
| 11   | 01  | TOUCH_EVENT         | Response  | P2           | `touch:uint8` (`1` touched) |

### 4.4 Lighting (`MODULE=0x6`)

| TYPE | CMD | Name           | Direction | Default PRIO | Payload |
|------|-----|----------------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| 10   | 00  | SET_DUTY       | Request   | P1           | `white:uint8, red:uint8, ir:uint8` |
| 11   | 00  | SET_DUTY_ACK   | Response  | P3           | `white:uint8, red:uint8, ir:uint8` |
| 10   | 01  | GET_DUTY       | Request   | P3           | none |
| 11   | 01  | DUTY_STATUS    | Response  | P3           | `white:uint8, red:uint8, ir:uint8` |
| 10   | 10  | TURN_ON_GROUP  | Request   | P1           | `group:uint8` (`0` IR, `1` RED, `2` WHITE) |
| 10   | 11  | TURN_OFF       | Request   | P1           | optional `group:uint8` (empty = all) |

### 4.5 IR barrier (`MODULE=0x7`)

| TYPE | CMD | Name               | Direction | Default PRIO | Payload |
|------|-----|--------------------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| 10   | 00  | GET_BARRIER_STATUS | Request   | P3           | none |
| 11   | 00  | BARRIER_STATUS     | Response  | P3           | `barrier:uint8` (`0` clear, `1` blocked) |
| 11   | 01  | BARRIER_EVENT      | Response  | P2           | `barrier:uint8` (`1` on edge event) |

## 5) Arbitration behavior

With `PRIO` in the top bits, arbitration follows functional urgency before module identity:

1. lower `PRIO` wins first,
2. then lower `MODULE`,
3. then lower `TYPE`,
4. then lower `CMD`.

This avoids permanent dominance by low module IDs and matches the target policy: `error > control > event > status/telemetry`.

## 6) Worked examples

- Broadcast scan request (`P3`, `BROADCAST`, common request, `SCAN`):
  - bits: `011 1111 00 00`
- Nosepoke event (`P2`, `NOSEPOKE`, module response, `BEAM_EVENT`):
  - bits: `010 0011 11 01`
- Lighting set duty (`P1`, `LIGHTING`, module request, `SET_DUTY`):
  - bits: `001 0110 10 00`
- Feeder reward request (`P1`, `FEEDER`, module request, `REQUEST_REWARD`):
  - bits: `001 0010 10 01`, ID `0x129`, no payload
- Feeder reward delivered on the third attempt (`P3`, `FEEDER`, module response,
  `REWARD_STATUS`):
  - bits: `011 0010 11 00`, ID `0x32C`, payload `01 03` (pellet present, 3 attempts)
- Feeder pellet taken from the well (`P2`, `FEEDER`, module response,
  `REWARD_STATUS`):
  - bits: `010 0010 11 00`, ID `0x22C`, payload `00 03`
- Feeder delivery failure after 20 attempts (`P0`, `FEEDER`, common response,
  `ERROR`):
  - bits: `000 0010 01 10`, ID `0x026`, payload `01 14`

## 7) Capacity note

This layout provides `2` command bits (`CMD=0..3`) per TYPE namespace.
If a module later needs more than 4 module-specific operations, use either:

- one `CMD` value as a payload sub-opcode container, or
- a protocol v2 based on 29-bit IDs.

## 8) Where the current code differs from this specification

The specification above is the version of 6 October 2026 (ICM GitLab commit `1fda77b`, in the Software repository since release `biorxiv-v1`), which brought the feeder section in line with the code: `REWARD_STATUS` payload, `REWARD_ON` / `REWARD_OFF`, pellet presence reporting and the 1/25 disc step. The developers confirmed that **the firmware is the reference** (its values were tested and adjusted on hardware). The points below still differ; trust the right-hand column.

| Area | Specification above | Current code |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **IR barrier events** | `BARRIER_EVENT` payload `barrier:uint8` | Payload is two bytes: `[line_index, state]` (`state` `1` = beam broken, `0` = clear), one event per accepted edge, debounced at 10 ms |
| **IR barrier status** | `BARRIER_STATUS` payload `barrier:uint8` | Payload is `[mask, last_triggered_line]`, with one bit per beam in `mask` (same `CMD=00` response) |
| **Lighting `TURN_OFF`** | Optional group; empty = all | As specified from the CLI. The V2 mapping always sends the group byte, because white and red are driven independently |
| **Screen pattern numbers** | `pattern_id:uint8` (not enumerated) | The screen program accepts `0` black, `1` white, `2` blink, `3` vertical lines, `4` horizontal lines, `5` grid, `6` and `7` the two diagonals. The V2 mapping sends the application's 4-bit pattern code, which uses different numbers (see {doc}`architecture`) |
