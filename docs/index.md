## What this repo is
- The public site and documentation source for Beatbox, built with Next.js and Markdown content.
- Community and contributor docs (this MkDocs site) for operations, hardware guidance, and development workflow.
- Integration points for future firmware/runtime and data tooling references; add links as those repos are published.

## Beatbox at a glance
- Ecological, automated operant-conditioning and home-cage monitoring for mice with 24/7 task access.
- Addresses short, stressful, experimenter-dependent sessions and poor standardization across labs.
- Modular hardware: environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, light), behavioral sensors (IR beam breaks, nosepoke, levers, capacitive touch), audio I/O, and a microcontroller with real-time firmware.
- Streams data to a local PC or server via USB or Wi‑Fi; exposes Python clients and REST/WebSocket APIs for access.
