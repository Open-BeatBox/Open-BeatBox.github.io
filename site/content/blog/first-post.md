Beatbox is an open, modular home-cage cognitive monitoring system for mice. It is designed to enable continuous, ecological behavioral experiments while improving welfare and standardization.

In this first post, we summarize the motivation behind Beatbox, its core design principles, and how you can start exploring the hardware, firmware, and software stack.

Future posts will cover build tutorials, validation datasets, and integrations with other home-cage monitoring systems.
