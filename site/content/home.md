    title: "Context & Scientific Background"
    body: "Behavioral neuroscience seeks to explain how neural circuits give rise to behavior in normal and pathological conditions. Rodent models provide access to neural recording and manipulation during task performance, but traditional setups often disrupt circadian rhythms, motivation, and long-term dynamics. BEATBox was developed so animals live inside the behavioral apparatus throughout an experiment, engaging autonomously with minimal experimenter interaction."
