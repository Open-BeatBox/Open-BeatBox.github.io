    body: |
      *BEATBox is an autonomous home-cage behavioral system that lets rodents live inside the experimental apparatus while continuously performing tasks.*

      > By removing repeated handling, artificial session boundaries, and experimenter-driven timing, BEATBox preserves circadian rhythms, motivation, and long-term behavioral dynamics. The result is richer, more ecological data with higher reproducibility and lower animal stress.
